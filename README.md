Heapsort-Cpp
============

This small C++ project implements a version of Heapsort.

To use the code you should include HeapSort.cpp and call HeapSort::heapSort( heap<T> &theHeap). The heapSort function only takes 1 parameter, a heap of the items to be sorted.  A definition of heap struct is in HeapSort.cpp.

Class T can be just about anything, but the sort has to be able to use comparasion operators like <. >, <=, and >= on the objects.
